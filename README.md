## About me :

Hello👋🏼 I'm Aman Kapoor (I go by **BugBot7000** here)

I'm a **Game Programmer**🧮 and **Producer**📝;

* 🛠️ I love to write gameplay systems, engine tools and UI code, the fewer google search results about a programming challenge, the better !
* 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of games ( always fun to dive into a new codebase)
* 🌐 I also have a personal website which you can visit at [amankapoor.xyz](amankapoor.xyz "amankapoor.xyz")
