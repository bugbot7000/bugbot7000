## About me :

Hello👋🏼 I'm Aman Kapoor (I go by **BugBot7000** here)

I'm a **Game Programmer**🧮;

* 🛠️ I love to work on UI, write systems and play games on absurd display resolutions. Engine based problems and challenges are fun ! The fewer google search results about a programming challenge, the better !
* 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of games ( always fun to dive into a new codebase)
* 🌐 I also have a personal website which you can visit at [amankapoor.xyz](amankapoor.xyz "amankapoor.xyz")
* I'm a gamdev. Why do I love homebrew so much !
